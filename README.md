# Gamma Spectroscopy Practical Toolkit

Welcome to the Gamma Spectroscopy Practical Toolkit! This toolkit provides a set of Python scripts for analyzing energy spectra obtained from gamma spectroscopy experiments. It is designed to assist in the identification of radioactive samples based on their characteristic peaks.

## Features

- **Data Import:** Easily import energy spectra data from CSV files.
- **Peak Detection:** Automatically detect peaks in the spectra using signal processing techniques.
- **Gaussian Fitting:** Fit Gaussian curves to the identified peaks for peak characterization.
- **Interactive Plotting:** Visualize the original spectra along with the fitted Gaussian curves for easy analysis and interpretation.

## Usage

1. **Installation:** Download the `gaussian_fit.py` file or clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Gamma-Spectroscopy-Prac.git

2. **Dependencies** Install the required Python dependencies using pip.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Data Preparation** Prepare your energy spectra data in CSV format. Save the USX file as a csv in the application.
    
4. **Analysis** Copy `gaussian_fit.py` and change `source_filename` 
   
6. **Visualisation** Visualize the analyzed spectra and Gaussian fits using the generated plots.
